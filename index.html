        <p>Encrypted Transmission: <em>"Hope today brings you great joy, fun and many memories"</em></p>
        <p>Throughout the Heavens and Earth I am the honoured one to be able to call you my best friend! You truly deserve every good thing that comes your way and some more! Because you are the GOAT! You are genuinely one of my favourite people ever and everyone I speak to knows it! Your righteous nature and kindness and passion inspires me to become the best version of myself, and I wouldnt be half the man I am today without the advice, memories, memes and friendship that I have made with you. So honestly I thank you so much for being who you are, never change your principles, for they were forged in the hottest flames and may they never be extinguished. <br> And of course, HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY BRUZZAH! - From your BESTO FRIENDO, Nassim</p>
